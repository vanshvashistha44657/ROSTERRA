🚨 EMERGENCY FIX - Can't Login

QUICK FIX (30 seconds):
=======================

1. Open new terminal

2. Run:
   cd server
   node scripts/migrateExistingUsers.js

3. Done! You can now login.

=======================

What this does:
- Sets all existing users to "approved" status
- You can login immediately
- New signups will still need approval

Already fixed in code:
- Default status changed to "approved"
- Only /signup creates pending users
- Everything else is approved automatically
