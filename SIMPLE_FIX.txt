🚨 SIMPLE FIX - 3 Steps

Your error: "Unexpected token '<' - is not valid JSON"

WHY: Backend server doesn't have the new /api/users route loaded


✅ FIX:
=======

1. Find your backend terminal (where you ran "npm run dev")

2. Press: Ctrl + C (to stop it)

3. Run again:
   cd C:\Users\Dell\Downloads\ROSTERRA\server
   npm run dev

4. Wait for: "✅ Loaded route: /api/users"

5. Refresh your browser (F5)

DONE! ✅


WHAT TO EXPECT:
===============

After restart, you'll see:
✅ MongoDB connected
✅ Loaded route: /api/auth
✅ Loaded route: /api/roasters
✅ Loaded route: /api/users    ← NEW! Must see this
🚀 Server running on port 5000


If you don't see "✅ Loaded route: /api/users", the route file might be missing.


QUICK CHECK:
============

File should exist: C:\Users\Dell\Downloads\ROSTERRA\server\routes\users.js

If missing, I can recreate it!
